        in Boracay will be our conference venue and hotel for the 2015 RubyConfPH.
      %p
        Located off Station 2’s Main Road, it is just a few minutes away from the famous White Beach and D’Mall,
        Boracay’s main entertainment and shopping area. Resort facilities include the Boracay Oceanarium, home
        of the world’s largest pearl; the WaveRider, Philippines’ first surfing pool; and
        an aquarium where you can swim like a mermaid.

        How to get there
      %p
        For first timers to Boracay, we recommend getting land and boat transfers from tour agencies.
        Cebu Pacific offers them during flights. You may also book transfers upon landing at Caticlan or Kalibo Airports.
      %p
        If you want Crown Regency Resort and Convention Center to arrange your land and boat transfers,
        you may email our Account Manager, Ariane Que at
        %a{href: 'mailto:ariane.que@crownregency.com'} ariane.que@crownregency.com.

      %p
        1. Land at Caticlan Airport (MPH) or Kalibo International Airport (KLO).
        Only small planes, which allow 10kg baggage allowance, can land at Caticlan Airport.
        If coming from outside the Philippines and landing at Caticlan, please confirm allowable
        luggage weight with your airline.
      %p
        2. From Caticlan Airport, a 5-minute tricycle ride will take you to Caticlan Jetty Port.
        If coming from Kalibo International Airport, it’ll be a 1.5 to 2-hour bus ride to the jetty port.
      %p
        3. Ride a ferry boat from Caticlan Jetty Port to Boracay Island (10 minutes).
        Aside from buying your ferry ticket (PHP 30), you will need to pay PHP 75 environmental fee
        and PHP 100 terminal fee at the port.  Ferry boats run from 5:00 am to 9:00 pm.
        Porters are available to assist you with your luggage for PHP 20.
      %p
        4. Once you reach Boracay Island, hire a tricycle or van to take you to your hotel.

      %p
        There are a lot of flights from Manila (MNL) to Caticlan and Kalibo.

      %p
        Regular flights from Manila to Kalibo are around Php 4,400 roundtrip but the price can go as low as Php 1,800 for promo fares at Cebu Pacific. Philippine Airlines have good prices even to Caticlan. You can mix and match your airlines for the best price.
      %p
        International attendees will need to change in Manila (MNL). Allot 2 hours or more between your flights since you have to check-in again and you might have to transfer to a different terminal.
      %p
        The conference is on Friday and Saturday, welcome drinks on Thursday night (March 26). You're at the beach so consider staying an extra day before and/or after the conference.
